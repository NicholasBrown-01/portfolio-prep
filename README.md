## About myself --prework

1. Looking for the next challenge

2. U.S Airforce Airborne Flight Engineer, U.S Army Black Hawk Pilot, now Software Developer. I love working in dynamic and challenging environments and pushing myself to always rise to the occasion.

3. I am Nicholas Brown. I am a Software Developer with a somewhat unique background. I have 16 years of combined experience as a technician in the U.S Air Force working in  Intelligence, flying on the RC-135 Reconnaissance Jet, and then as a Pilot in Command for the U.S Armyâ€™s Black Hawk Helicopter.

I started my career as an entry student working with Red Hat Linux systems to control U.S Collection Systems. Over the course of a decade I worked my way up to eventually leading a team of instructors developing and implementing training course syllabi and real-time environment education scenarios. I also provided supervision and quality control for our international contractors in their training, qualification, and evaluation programs.

But Life throws curveballs. Mine came in the form of an injury while flying one day. I took some time to collect myself and reassess. I discovered Software Development that was mentally challenging, dynamic, and heavy into problem-solving. All things I love and pride myself in being skilled at.

The company I work for gets to take immediate advantage of someone who has spent nearly 2 decades operating in some of the most critical problem-solving environments, and now apply that team-work, understanding, work ethic, and drive to quickly benefit the team and organization.

4. What excites me most about the world of technology is it is without limits. It is only a matter of time before any problem can be solved.
